 * Metadata class
 *
 * This class describes the content of a multimedia item like a video or audio file.
 *
 * It contains some general information like the title or a detailed description of
 * the content and one or more resources to the file.
 *
 * Why are multiple resources possible, though I just have that one file? Lets say,
 * you want to display images. It is very useful if there are thumbnail pictures
 * available, which may speed up the display process as the UPnP media renderer may
 * first display those thumbnails rather than the huge image itself. Those images
 * both refer to the same meta information. However, they have different resource
 * information. This may also apply to videos (different resolution, bit rate,
 * whatever...)
 *
 * Every plugin implementor is requested to add as much as available information about
 * a resource, because the media renderer may display them in their user interface,
 * which in turn makes the navigation and identifying the contents much easier.
 *
 * The metadata class itself offers some major properties, which are very common in
 * the VDRs context. However, the implementor may add additional custom information
 * to the list of properties.
 *
 * A Property with the same name but different value may exist multiple times. It is
 * added multiple times to the output. Property attributes are NOT supported. However,
 * there only a handful of attributes, which are likely to be unimportant.
